Structures:

Location: Represents a location with an ID, name, address, and type (hospital or warehouse).
RoadNode: Represents a node in the adjacency list of the graph, containing destination, traffic level, and a pointer to the next node.
Connection: Represents a connection between two locations with a traffic level.
Class DeliveryGraph:

Constructor: Initializes the graph with locations and connections, creating an adjacency list for each location.
PrintRoadList: Prints the connections (roads) for a given location.
PrintDeliveryGraph: Prints all the roads for every location in the graph.
FindDestinationId: Finds the ID of a location given its name.
Destructor: Cleans up dynamically allocated memory.
Dijkstra's Algorithm:

MinRouteNode: Represents a node in the min-heap used by Dijkstra's algorithm, containing a vertex and its distance.
MinRouteHeap: Manages the min-heap, including operations like extracting the minimum distance node and decreasing key values.
DijkstraAlgorithm: Finds the shortest path from a source location to a destination location using Dijkstra's algorithm.
GenerateDeliveryMap Function:

Creates a graph with predefined connections and random traffic levels.
main Function:

Initializes the graph.
Displays information about hospitals and warehouses.
Prompts the user to enter required resources and the hospital name.
Uses Dijkstra's algorithm to find the most efficient warehouse to deliver resources to the specified hospital.
Outputs the most efficient warehouse.
The code effectively models a delivery system where warehouses are connected to hospitals, and it uses Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm to determine the most efficient warehouse for delivering resources to a hospital based on traffic conditions.
